# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

## 1. Problem Statement

In today's vast digital landscape, users are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available movies. The challenge is to help users discover movies they will genuinely enjoy, enhancing their viewing experience and engagement. This project aims to address this by building a robust movie recommendation system.

## 2. Project Overview

This project develops a **movie recommendation system** designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and the similarity between movies. The system leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations.

### Key Objectives:
- Recommend movies based on user preferences.
- Identify similar movies using various metrics.
- Enhance user experience by providing personalized suggestions.

## 3. Workflow & Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded and merged movie and rating datasets.
- Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
- Transformed data for compatibility with recommendation algorithms.

### Recommendation Algorithms:
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilized user-item interaction data to find similar users or items.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommended movies based on features of movies a user has liked in the past (e.g., genres, keywords).
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Combined collaborative and content-based methods for improved accuracy and diversity.

### Model Evaluation:
- Employed metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for rating prediction and precision/recall for recommendation accuracy.

## 4. Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise (for recommendation systems)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- JupyterLab / Google Colab

## ðŸ“Š 5. Dataset Information

- **Source:** MovieLens dataset (e.g., MovieLens 100k, 1M, or 20M, depending on the specific implementation within the notebook).
- **Features include:**
  - `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie.
  - `title`: Title of the movie, often including the release year.
  - `genres`: Categorization of the movie (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
  - `userId`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `rating`: Rating given by a user to a movie (typically on a 1-5 scale).
  - `timestamp`: Time when the rating was given.

## âœ… 6. Final Results

The recommendation system successfully provides personalized movie suggestions. While specific metrics like RMSE or precision/recall would depend on the exact implementation and evaluation within the notebook, the system demonstrates the ability to:
- Generate relevant movie recommendations.
- Adapt to individual user preferences.
- Improve movie discovery for users.

Further optimization and fine-tuning of algorithms could lead to even more accurate and diverse recommendations.
